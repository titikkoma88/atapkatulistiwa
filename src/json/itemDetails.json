  "description": "<p>Semeru is Java’s highest peak and has been active for decades which is part of the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. A cloud of black volcanic ash and sand is frequently released from near the summit, sometimes once an hour, sometimes as often as every ten minutes. There have been numerous fatalities, but it is a popular and safe hike if you treat the mountain with respect and as Java’s highest peak, it is one of the finest hikes in Indonesia.</p> <p>The trail starts at the village of Ranu Pani (2,109m) where there is basic accommodation available and you will need a minimum of two full days for the hike to the summit and back. The standard choice now is to spend one night at Ranu Kumbolo and a second at Kalimati before making a pre-dawn ascent to the summit, although if you are very fit and start early enough on Day 1 you can just stay at Kalimati and complete in two days total.</p> <p>There are many trekking agencies in East Java who offer jeep transport across the length and breadth of the National Park including the vast Bromo caldera and to Ranu Pani village itself from the city of Malang via Tumpang. Thankfully it is not yet possible to drive to the summit of Semeru! However, the road from Malang to Ranu Pani offers breathtaking views and reaches an elevation of over 2,400m at its highest point.</p>",
